2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell ALUop_reg[1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) ALUop_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Reg2Loc_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Reg2Loc_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell RegWrite_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MemToReg_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch ALUop_reg[0]/L7 (in ALUop_reg[0] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin ALUop_reg[0]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch ALUop_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin ALUop_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch ALUsrc_reg/L7 (in ALUsrc_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin ALUsrc_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Branch_reg/L7 (in Branch_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Branch_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch MemRead_reg/L7 (in MemRead_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin MemRead_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch MemToReg_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin MemToReg_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch MemWrite_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin MemWrite_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Reg2Loc_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Reg2Loc_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch RegWrite_reg/L7 (in RegWrite_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin RegWrite_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
